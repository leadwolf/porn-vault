## Config

See https://github.com/porn-vault/porn-vault/blob/dev/doc/config.md

## How to run

- Install and run Elasticsearch (https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/install-elasticsearch.html)
- Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/porn-vault/porn-vault/releases) page and download the latest version, for the platform of your choice
- Unzip the file
- Run the application in the terminal of your choice and follow the on-screen instructions
- Once your app is setup you can visit it on `http://localhost:3000` (or your LAN IP equivalent) in your web browser of choice

> NOTE: If manually running in the terminal by doing `porn-vault.exe` or `./porn-vault`, you **MUST** be in the same directory as the executable.
> Examples:
>
> - `./path/to/vault/porn-vault.exe` will not work
> - `cd ./path/to/vault`, `porn-vault.exe` will work

### Docker

See the [docker readme](https://github.com/porn-vault/porn-vault/blob/dev/doc/docker.md)

## Enabling HTTPS

- If you're on Windows you first need to download openssl, you can find the executables [here](https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Binaries)
- Generate a keypair using the command `openssl req -nodes -new -x509 -keyout server.key -out server.cert`
- Set the `ENABLE_HTTPS` flag in your config to true
- Change the `HTTPS_KEY` & `HTTPS_CERT` options to your generated key & cert file paths
- Open `https://localhost:3000`, ignore the self-generated certificate warning and enjoy an encrypted experience
