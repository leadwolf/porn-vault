## Config

If the program cannot find a config file, the program will go through an interactive setup, and then create a config file for you.

> Note: not all settings will be prompted to the user, the rest will automatically taken from defaults, [that you can find here](https://github.com/porn-vault/porn-vault/blob/dev/src/config/default.ts).

### Config location

The config file must adjacent to the program itself, and can either be JSON or YAML. It must be named `config.json` or `config.yaml`. If both files exist, the program will use JSON over YAML.

### Adjusting the config
 
A base config file [can be found here](https://github.com/porn-vault/porn-vault/blob/dev/config.json.example). It's used for Docker containers, but you can copy the file even if you are not using Docker.
You just need to adjust the values for `binaries.ffmpeg` and `binaries.ffprobe`, as those depend on your setup. Here's how they should look:
```json
{
  "binaries": {
    "ffmpeg": "path/to/your/ffmpeg",
    "ffprobe": "path/to/your/ffprobe",
  },
}
```

If you do not have FFMPEG, download them manually or start the program without a config: when starting the program **without** a config, the program will ask you if it should download these binaries and will automatically set the paths if it does.
