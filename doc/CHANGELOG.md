## 0.27.0

### Highlights

#### ‚ú® Initial transcoding support
More files can now be scanned and played in the app thanks to cpu/gpu transcoding. The supported extensions are `.m4v, .mp4, .mov, .wmv, .avi, .mpg, .mpeg, .rmvb, .rm, .flv, .asf, .mkv, .webm,`.  
Scenes can be played via multiple streaming methods:
- `direct play:` the file is sent straight to the browser
- `mkv direct stream:` an MKV file an MP4 compatible video stream is remuxed to MP4. Low cpu requirements
- `mp4 transcode:` hardware acceleration possible (`transcode.h264` in config)
- `webm transcode:` cpu acceleration only (`transcode.webm` in config)

Scenes will attempt to play in this order, going to the next streaming method if the browser fails to play the current stream.  

üöß ATTENTION: This feature is still in development and may not work exactly perfectly. For large files, this may not be fast enough. You can try adjusting the new transcode settings in your config file.  
Additionally only the `vaapi, amf, qsv` methods have been tested by only a couple of people. Feel free to test and report your setup.


#### ‚ú® Improved video player
Added playback rate controls, fit width/height, theater mode, improved scrubbing experience, better touch support, tap to seek.

#### ‚ú® New markers page
There is now a new markers page to manage all the markers created. You can also jump directly to the scene's page at the marker's time.

#### ‚ú® Initial data support in plugins
Plugins can now access the initial state of items for richer queries or data manipulation.  
For plugin developers, this means that you can now access more data such as a scene's studio, its actors, its movies...
For example, a scene matcher plugin can use the scene's studio in its queries, or a renamer plugin can use these values to insert them into the filename.  
From the user's standpoint, nothing changes but your plugins can only get better !

### üí• Migration guide

- `$cheerio` has been removed from the plugin function context. Any plugin that uses cheerio must be updated and will not be backwards compatible with 0.26
- - Plugin devs: you must now import it directly: `import cheerio from "cheerio"`
- - Plugin users: you should download updated versions of your plugins
