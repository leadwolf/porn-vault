# Plugins

## Register plugin

To use a plugin, first it needs to be registered in the config.json/yaml.
In this case, the plugin source (js file) is stored in a folder called plugins

JSON

```javascript
{
  "plugins": {
    "register": {
      "femaleplugin": {
        "path": "./plugins/female.js"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

YAML

```yaml
---
plugins:
  register:
    femaleplugin:
      path: "./plugins/female.js"
```

## Run registered plugin

Run the registered plugin every time an actor is created (see 'Events' for more info on events).
Every event accepts a list of plugins to run _in series_.
Plugin results will be **aggregated** into one object and then processed.
That means the results of the last plugin to run have higher priority.

JSON

```javascript
{
  "plugins": {
    "events": {
      "actorCreated": ["femaleplugin"]
    }
  }
}
```

YAML

```yaml
---
plugins:
  events:
    actorCreated:
      - femaleplugin
```

## Events

### Actor

- **`actorCreated`**
- - Ran when an actor is created
- **`actorCustom`**
- - Ran when the user runs the plugin manually in the interface

### Scene

- **`sceneCreated`**
- - Ran when an actor is created
- **`sceneCustom`**
- - Ran when the user runs the plugin manually in the interface

### Movie

        "path": "./plugins/imaginaryapi.js",
        "args": {

        }
