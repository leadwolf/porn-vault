# Getting started

1. Install and run Elasticsearch ([Installation guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/install-elasticsearch.html))
2. Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/porn-vault/porn-vault/releases) page and download the latest version, for the platform of your choice
3. Unzip the file
4. Run the application in the terminal (CMD for Windows) of your choice and follow the on-screen instructions
5. Once your app is setup you can visit it on `http://localhost:3000` (or your LAN IP equivalent) in your web browser of choice

> NOTE: If manually running in the terminal by doing `porn-vault.exe` or `./porn-vault`, you **MUST** be in the same directory as the executable.
> Examples:
>
> - `./path/to/vault/porn-vault.exe` will not work
> - `cd ./path/to/vault`, `porn-vault.exe` will work
